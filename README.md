•	Conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database to identify hot zones of terrorism and their underlying causes.

•	Analyzed the data to draw insights as a defense analyst, such as identifying the countries and regions that suffered the highest and lowest number of attacks and the types of attacks that were most prevalent in each area and suggested potential measures to reduce terrorism.

Tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter notebook

Project Description: Terrorism has become a significant concern worldwide, affecting millions of people every year. Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) can help to identify trends and patterns in terrorist incidents and provide insights into the factors driving terrorism. In this project, we will
use Python to analyze terrorism data and gain insights into the trends and patterns of terrorist incidents worldwide.

The project will involve the following steps:

* Data collection: Collect terrorism data from reliable sources such as the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). We will use Python libraries such
as pandas and NumPy to read, manipulate and preprocess the data.

* Data cleaning: The collected data may contain inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. We will clean the data by removing or imputing
missing values and removing outliers.

* Data visualization: We will use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visualizations, such as line charts, bar
charts, and heatmaps, to explore the trends and patterns of terrorism.

* Statistical analysis: We will use Python libraries such as SciPy and Statsmodels to perform statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing and
regression analysis, to identify the factors that drive terrorism.

* Machine learning: We will use Python libraries such as Scikit-learn to build machine learning models, such as clustering and classification,
to predict the likelihood of terrorist incidents and identify the factors that contribute to their occurrence.

The output of the project will be a report containing the insights gained from the data analysis and visualizations, along with the machine
learning models’ predictions. We can use this report to gain insights into the terrorist incidents’ nature and factors driving them and help
policymakers make informed decisions to combat terrorism.
